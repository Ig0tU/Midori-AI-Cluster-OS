## PixelArch OS: A Docker-Optimized Arch Linux Distribution

PixelArch OS is a lightweight and efficient Arch Linux distribution specifically designed for Docker environments. It offers a streamlined platform for developing, deploying, and managing containerized applications.

**Key Features:**

* **Arch-Based:** Leverages the flexibility and customization of Arch Linux.
* **Docker-Optimized:** Built with Docker in mind for seamless containerization.
* **Frequent Updates:** Ensures security and performance with regular updates.
* **Package Management:**  Uses `yay` and `pacman` for easy package management.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lunamidori5/Midori-AI-Cluster-OS.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the `aiclusteros` Directory

```bash
cd Midori-AI-Cluster-OS/aiclusteros
```

### 3. Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t pixelarch -f arch_dockerfile .
```

### 4. Run the Image and Access the Shell

**Using `docker run`:**

```bash
docker run -it pixelarch /bin/bash
```

**Using `docker-compose`:**

**a. Edit the `docker-compose.yaml` file:**

```yaml
services:
  pixelarch-os:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: ./arch_dockerfile
    tty: true  # Enable colorized logs
    restart: always  # Consider using `on-failure`
    command: ["sleep", "infinity"]
```

**b. Start the container in detached mode:**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

**c. Access the container shell:**

```bash
docker exec -it aiclusteros-pixelarch-os-1 /bin/bash
```

## Package Management

Use the `yay` package manager to install and update software:

```bash
yay -Syu <package_name>
```

**Example:**

```bash
yay -Syu vim
```

This will install or update the `vim` text editor.

**Note:**

* Replace `<package_name>` with the actual name of the package you want to install or update.
* The `-Syu` flag performs a full system update, including package updates and dependencies.
